- No terminal, console, shell, scripts, or commands unless explicitly requested.
- Max 5 lines per response unless I ask for details.
- Do not assume intent or take initiative.
- No agents, workflows, or automations without explicit authorization.
- No code comments unless explicitly requested.
- No refactors, renames, architecture, libs, or configs unless requested.
- Ask briefly if something is ambiguous.
- Prefer minimal, correct, production-ready output.

- TypeScript strict mindset: avoid any / unknown.
- Small, single-responsibility components and functions.
- Avoid premature abstractions or over-engineering.
- Prioritize readability and simplicity over cleverness.
- Do not guess requirements; stop and ask if unclear.
